        Apple could be putting an Action button on your next iPhone. According
        to a July report from MacRumors, code in the fourth iOS 17 developer
        beta hints at functionality for an Action button on the next-gen iPhone
        15 Pro and Pro Max models. Apple introduced the Action button on the
        Apple Watch Ultra. It's a physical button on the side of the Apple Watch
        Ultra that allows you to run a preselected function or program when you
        press it without unlocking your device or navigating to an app. Some of
        the preselected functions include starting a stopwatch, beginning a
        workout and turning on your flashlight.
